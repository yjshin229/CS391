img tag stands alone. has 2 attributes. 
jpeg,png,gif,svg is the only formats that are supported in web browsers.
jpeg -> easily modified in terms of size
svg -> infinitely scalable resolution. ideal for logos, icons and illustrations...
gif -> ideal for small animations that has less than 256 colors

video, audio tags are no more likely used in web browsers. Bad compatibility.
iframe is used instead. 

img tags don't occupy the entire width of the screen. (inline elements)
ex)<img>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <td>, <th>

block level elements : ex)<p>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <table>, <tr>, <h1> ... <h6>, <hr>

Don't OVER USE DIV tag. IF there is an alternative, use the other ones.
overusing the div tag kills the search engines ability.

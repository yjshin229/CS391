            <h3>Program Overview</h3>
            <p>
              As a student at Boston University, I am immersed in the rigorous
              Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program, which is renowned
              for its comprehensive curriculum and cutting-edge research
              opportunities. This program has enabled me to develop a strong
              foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computing,
              from fundamental programming techniques to complex algorithmic
              problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p>
              My minor in Visual Arts complements my technical training by
              providing me with a creative outlet and a deeper appreciation for
              aesthetic principles. It has allowed me to explore diverse mediums
              and techniques, fostering a unique interdisciplinary perspective
              that I bring to my technological endeavors.

            <h3>Course Highlights</h3>
            <p>
              Throughout my studies, I've engaged with a variety of courses that
              have been instrumental in shaping my expertise and skills. Some of
              the key courses include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Advanced Programming Techniques:</strong> Where I honed
                my coding skills in various programming languages and learned
                about software development best practices.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms:</strong> This course
                taught me the critical importance of efficiency and optimization
                in code, a skill essential for tackling complex computational
                problems.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Computer Systems:</strong> A deep dive into the
                architecture of computing systems provided me with insights into
                how software and hardware interact.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> I explored the
                fascinating world of AI, learning about machine learning
                algorithms and their applications in the real world.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Digital Media Production:</strong> In this course, I
                developed my artistic skills, creating digital content that
                leverages my technical background in computer science.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each course not only advanced my knowledge but also challenged me
              to apply what I've learned in practical, real-world projects and
              collaborative work.

            <h3>Extracurricular Activities</h3>
            <p>
              At Boston University, I believe in the power of applying classroom
              knowledge to extracurricular projects. I am actively involved in
              the Computer Science Club, where we develop software solutions for
              community-based problems. Additionally, I contribute to the Visual
              Arts Society, curating art exhibitions that blend technology and
              art.
            </p>
            <p>
              My involvement in these activities has not only broadened my
              network within the academic community but also allowed me to
              contribute meaningfully to various causes through technology and
              art.

            <p>
              As a Frontend Engineer Intern at Classum, I played an integral
              role in the UI/UX frontend development of an app designed as a
              private open communication-based community tool for organizations
              such as companies and schools. The application is now actively
              serving over 11,000 clients across more than 32 countries.
            </p>

            <p>My contributions to the project included:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Utilizing Metro as the bundler for app development to achieve
                faster bundling times, efficient optimization, and seamless
                integration with React Native, which provided distinct
                advantages over webpack.
              </li>
              <li>
                Implementing a robust frontend-backend communication framework
                by integrating Axios for REST API calls, optimizing asynchronous
                operations, and data transfer using Data Transfer Objects
                (DTOs).
              </li>
              <li>
                Employing Yarn for package management and version control
                alongside Fastlane to automate various development workflow
                tasks, ensuring efficient testing, deployment, and release
                processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Enhancing code quality and maintainability by implementing
                ESLint and leveraging TypeScript's static type checking within
                React Native development to detect errors early.
              </li>
              <li>
                Optimizing application performance, especially in the rendering
                of substantial data, by leveraging Recoil for state management.
              </li>
              <li>
                Creating smooth and responsive animations using React Native
                Reanimated, prioritizing app performance and user experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                Integrating Bugsnag for real-time error tracking and Flipper for
                debugging purposes, which included network checks and
                performance monitoring.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developing a notifications feature using deep linking and
                react-native navigation to enhance user engagement within the
                app.
              </li>
            </ul>
